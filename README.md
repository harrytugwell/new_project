## Concepts/tools you _must_ use

You _must_ use _all_ of the following in your project _appropriately_:

* Basics: control flow and appropriate use of containers
* Functions: abstraction and decomposition
  * Your project must include at least one function
* Modules: modularisation
  * Your project must have at least one .py file serves as a module and import at least one module / library
* OOP: encapsulation, abstraction, composition, inheritance (when appropriate)
* Functional programming: pure functions, use of higher order functions, immutable data (objects and variables not changed)
* Jupyter Notebook

## List of modules / libraries / data structures that you can use

You can use the tools below:

random and any of the functionality provided by it
functools.reduce() (for Q1 only)
set and any of the functionality provided by it
Pandas and Numpy, but you can only use them for the tasks that specified that you can use them
matplotlib (for Q3 only)
For any "optional" or "additional" functionality / analysis that you want to add, there is no restriction on what you can use.
